Taking **RGB image** as input, converting it to **GrayScale**.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Creating an array from image data
input_image = Image.open("images/eagle.jpeg")
image_np = np.array(input_image)

# Preparing image for Edge detection
# Converting RGB image into GrayScale image
# Using formula:
# Y' = 0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B
image_GrayScale = image_np[:, :, 0] * 0.299 + image_np[:, :, 1] * 0.587 + image_np[:, :, 2] * 0.114
```

Setting **Hyperparameters** and applying **Pad frame** for input image.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Applying to the GrayScale image Pad frame with zero values
# Using NumPy method 'pad'
GrayScale_image_with_pad = np.pad(image_GrayScale, (1, 1), mode='constant', constant_values=0)
# Checking the shape
print(GrayScale_image_with_pad.shape)  # (272, 482)

# Preparing image for convolution
# In order to get filtered image (convolved input image) in the same size, it is needed to set Hyperparameters
# Filter (kernel) size, K_size = 3
# Step for sliding (stride), Step = 1
# Processing edges (zero valued frame around image), Pad = 1
# Consequently, output image size is (width and height are the same):
# Width_Out = (Width_In - K_size + 2*Pad)/Step + 1
# Imagine, that input image is 5x5 spatial size (width and height), then output image:
# Width_Out = (5 - 3 + 2*1)/1 + 1 = 5, and this is equal to input image
```

Declaring filters for **Edge Detection**.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Declaring standard filters (kernels) with size 3x3 for edge detection
filter_1 = np.array([[1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1]])
filter_2 = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, -4, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
filter_3 = np.array([[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 8, -1], [-1, -1, -1]])
```

Creating function to **delete negative values** from resulted image, also known as **ReLU function**, by substituting them with **0**.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# In order to prevent appearing values that are less than -1
# Following function is declared
def relu(array):
    # Preparing array for output result
    r = np.zeros_like(array)
    # Using 'np.where' setting condition that every element in 'array' has to be more than appropriate element in 'r'
    result = np.where(array > r, array, r)
    # Returning resulted array
    return result
```

Creating function to **delete values that are more than 255** by substituting them with **255**.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# In order to prevent appearing values that are more than 255
# The following function is declared
def image_pixels(array):
    # Preparing array for output result
    # Creating an empty array
    r = np.empty(array.shape)
    # Filling array with 255 value for all elements
    r.fill(255)
    # Using 'np.where' setting condition that every element in 'array' has to be less than appropriate element in 'r'
    result = np.where(array < r, array, r)
    # Returning resulted array
    return result
```

Implementing filtering for **Edge Detection**, also known as **Convolution Operation**.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Implementing convolution operation for Edge detection for GrayScale image
# Going through all input image with pad frame
for i in range(GrayScale_image_with_pad.shape[0] - 2):
    for j in range(GrayScale_image_with_pad.shape[1] - 2):
        # Extracting 3x3 patch (the same size with filter) from input image with pad frame
        patch_from_input_image = GrayScale_image_with_pad[i:i+3, j:j+3]
        # Applying elementwise multiplication and summation - this is convolution operation
        # With filter_1
        output_image_1[i, j] = np.sum(patch_from_input_image * filter_1)
        # With filter_2
        output_image_2[i, j] = np.sum(patch_from_input_image * filter_2)
        # With filter_3
        output_image_3[i, j] = np.sum(patch_from_input_image * filter_3)
```

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.misc import imread, imresize

"""
'imread' and 'imresize' will be removed from new version of 'Scipy 1.2.0'

For 'imread':

"""

# Reading images
cat, dog = imread('images/cat.jpg'), imread('images/dog.jpg')

# Defining difference between width and height
print(cat.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)
print(dog.shape)  # (1050, 1680, 3)
difference_cat = cat.shape[1] - cat.shape[0]
difference_dog = dog.shape[1] - dog.shape[0]
# Cropping images to make it square size
# Cropping by width and taking middle part
cat_cropped = cat[:, int(difference_cat / 2):int(-difference_cat / 2), :]
dog_cropped = dog[:, int(difference_dog / 2):int(-difference_dog / 2), :]
print(cat_cropped.shape)  # (1080, 1080, 3)
print(dog_cropped.shape)  # (1050, 1050, 3)

# Defining needed image size for resizing
image_size = 200
# Defining output array for new images
# For 2 images with height = width = image_size and 3 channels
# (channels come at the end in order to show resized image)
image_resized = np.zeros((2, image_size, image_size, 3))
print(image_resized.shape)  # (2, 200, 200, 3)
# Resizing two images

image_resized[1, :, :, :] = imresize(dog_cropped, (image_size, image_size))  # (200, 200, 3)
```

Preparing data for convolution operation.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Defining output array for new image
# For 2 images with 3 channels and height = width = image_size
x = np.zeros((2, 3, image_size, image_size))
# Resizing two images
# And transposing in order to put channels first
x[0, :, :, :] = imresize(cat_cropped, (image_size, image_size)).transpose((2, 0, 1))
x[1, :, :, :] = imresize(dog_cropped, (image_size, image_size)).transpose((2, 0, 1))
print(x[0].shape)  # (3, 200, 200)
print(x[1].shape)  # (3, 200, 200) 
```

Preparing weights for convolution for 2 filters with 3 channels and size 3x3.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Defining array for weights
w = np.zeros((2, 3, 3, 3))

# First filter converts images into grayscale
# Defining three channels for this filter - red, green and blue
w[0, 0, :, :] = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0.3, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
w[0, 1, :, :] = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0.6, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
w[0, 2, :, :] = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0.1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

# Second filter will detect horizontal edges in the blue channel
w[1, 2, :, :] = [[1, 2, 1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, -2, -1]]

# Defining 128 biases for the edge detection filter
# in order to make output non-negative
b = np.array([0, 128])
```

Defining function for naive forward pass with convolution.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
"""
Input consists of following:
x of shape (N, C, H, W) - N data, each with C channels, height H and width W.
w of shape (F, C, HH, WW) - We convolve each input with F different filters,
where each filter spans all C channels; each filter has height HH and width WW.

'cnn_params' is a dictionary with following keys:
'stride' - step for sliding
'pad' - zero-pad frame around input

Function returns volume of feature maps of shape (N, F, H', W') where:
H' = 1 + (H + 2 * pad - HH) / stride
W' = 1 + (W + 2 * pad - WW) / stride

N here is the same as we have it as number of input images.
F here is as number of channels of each N (that are now as feature maps)

    # Applying to the input image volume Pad frame with zero values for all channels
    # As we have in input x N as number of inputs, C as number of channels,
    # then we don't have to pad them
    # That's why we leave first two tuples with 0 - (0, 0), (0, 0)
    # And two last tuples with pad parameter - (pad, pad), (pad, pad)
    # In this way we pad only H and W of N inputs with C channels
