Taking RGB image as input, converting it to GrayScale.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Creating an array from image data
input_image = Image.open("images/eagle.jpeg")
image_np = np.array(input_image)

# Preparing image for Edge detection
# Converting RGB image into GrayScale image
# Using formula:
# Y' = 0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B
image_GrayScale = image_np[:, :, 0] * 0.299 + image_np[:, :, 1] * 0.587 + image_np[:, :, 2] * 0.114
```

Setting Hyperparameters and applying Pad frame for input image.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Applying to the GrayScale image Pad frame with zero values
# Using NumPy method 'pad'
GrayScale_image_with_pad = np.pad(image_GrayScale, (1, 1), mode='constant', constant_values=0)
# Checking the shape
print(GrayScale_image_with_pad.shape)  # (272, 482)

# Preparing image for convolution
# In order to get filtered image (convolved input image) in the same size, it is needed to set Hyperparameters
# Filter (kernel) size, K_size = 3
# Step for sliding (stride), Step = 1
# Processing edges (zero valued frame around image), Pad = 1
# Consequently, output image size is (width and height are the same):
# Width_Out = (Width_In - K_size + 2*Pad)/Step + 1
# Imagine, that input image is 5x5 spatial size (width and height), then output image:
# Width_Out = (5 - 3 + 2*1)/1 + 1 = 5, and this is equal to input image
```

Declaring filters for **Edge Detection**.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Declaring standard filters (kernels) with size 3x3 for edge detection
filter_1 = np.array([[1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1]])
filter_2 = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, -4, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
filter_3 = np.array([[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 8, -1], [-1, -1, -1]])
```

Creating function to delete negative values from resulted image.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# In order to prevent appearing values that are less than -1
# Following function is declared
def relu(array):
    # Preparing array for output result
    r = np.zeros_like(array)
    # Using 'np.where' setting condition that every element in 'array' has to be more than appropriate element in 'r'
    result = np.where(array > r, array, r)
    # Returning resulted array
    return result
```

Creating function to delete values that are more than 255.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# In order to prevent appearing values that are more than 255
# The following function is declared
def image_pixels(array):
    # Preparing array for output result
    # Creating an empty array
    r = np.empty(array.shape)
    # Filling array with 255 value for all elements
    r.fill(255)
    # Using 'np.where' setting condition that every element in 'array' has to be less than appropriate element in 'r'
    result = np.where(array < r, array, r)
    # Returning resulted array
    return result
```

Implementing filtering for **Edge Detection** also known as **Convolution Operation**.
<br/>Consider following part of the code:

```py
# Implementing convolution operation for Edge detection for GrayScale image
# Going through all input image with pad frame
for i in range(GrayScale_image_with_pad.shape[0] - 2):
    for j in range(GrayScale_image_with_pad.shape[1] - 2):
        # Extracting 3x3 patch (the same size with filter) from input image with pad frame
        patch_from_input_image = GrayScale_image_with_pad[i:i+3, j:j+3]
        # Applying elementwise multiplication and summation - this is convolution operation
        # With filter_1
        output_image_1[i, j] = np.sum(patch_from_input_image * filter_1)
        # With filter_2
        output_image_2[i, j] = np.sum(patch_from_input_image * filter_2)
        # With filter_3
        output_image_3[i, j] = np.sum(patch_from_input_image * filter_3)
```
